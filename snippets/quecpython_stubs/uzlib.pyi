Function:
The module uses the binary data compressed by DEFLATE Algorithm to decompress (generally used in the zlib library and the gzip archiver). 
This module realizes subsets of the corresponding CPython module. See CPython file zlib for more detailed information.

See CPython file struct for detailed information: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/zlib.html#module-zlib
